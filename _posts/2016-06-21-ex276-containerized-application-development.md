title: Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Containerized Application Development
---

**Quick note:** This week I decided to take a new certification exam: [Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Containerized Application Development (EX276)](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex276-red-hat-certificate-expertise-containerized-application-development).  Since I've been working with containers for more than 2 years, I submitted myself to this exam. The exam covers the creation and management of docker images, and different use cases for containers.

On the [exam page](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex276-red-hat-certificate-expertise-containerized-application-development) you can find more information like *"objectives"*, *"what you need to know"*, *"audience & prerequisites"* and *"recommended training"*.

The list for my current Red Hat certifications are available in the [Verify a Red Hat Certified Professional](https://www.redhat.com/rhtapps/certification/verify/?certId=111-061-115) page and also in the [*"About me"*](/about/) page.

You can also find a "Red Hat Certified Professional" near you in [this page](https://www.redhat.com/wapps/training/certification/search.html).
