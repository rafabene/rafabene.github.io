title: JDF 2.0.0.Final released!
---

Hi!!! Yesterday (10/24/2012) [JDF â€“ JBoss Developer Framework 2.0.0.Final](http://www.jboss.org/jdf/) was released. The focus in this release is mobile hybrid applications with [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/). This release has [65 quickstarts](http://www.jboss.org/developer-materials/#!) and [TicketMonster](http://www.jboss.org/ticket-monster/) example and its tutorial was also updated.

Another great part of this release is the [JBoss Stacks](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-stacks) subproject.  Have you ever wanted to know what Archetypes or BOMs did you need to use for an specific JBoss Version ? With [JBoss Stacks](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-stacks) you can easily have access to this information.

The Archetypes / BOMs / Runtimes relationship is kept in a [yaml file](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-stacks/blob/1.0.0.Final/stacks.yaml) on Github that provides these informations through [JBoss Stacks Client API](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-stacks-client). Some examples of JBoss Stacks use is the new [JBoss Tools 4](http://planet.jboss.org/post/jboss_tools_4_alpha_2_stacks_openshift_ssh_hibernate_tools_forge_debug_and_more) feature and the JBoss Stacks page itself.

Are you using [Forge](http://forge.jboss.org/)? No problem! You can also use JDF Forge plugin to get the right BOM on your project. To get more information about the BOM (Bill of Materials) concept take a look at the [Introduction to the Dependency Mechanism on Maven Site](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).

Enjoy!!!!
