**EDIT:** This post has been edited to reflact the latest changes as described [here](/2016/01/09/docker-images-openshift-network/)

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/), [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/), [OpenShift v3](http://www.openshift.org/) are some examples of tools and projects that are well consolidate in the container universe of Docker. Things are moving pretty fast and sometimes it's hard to move from a simple execution of a container ( *docker run -it fedora bash* ) to a Docker cluster in the cloud.

I've my own lab environment that consists in a [WildFly](http://www.wildfly.org/) container with [Ticket Monster application](http://www.jboss.org/ticket-monster/) connected to a [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) container. To load balance the application, I use [Apache httpd](https://httpd.apache.org/) with [mod_cluster](http://mod-cluster.jboss.org/). The overview diagram of this environment can be seen in the following picture:

This blog post will show a suggested learning path to have this environment to be executed in raw docker engine (CLI), docker-compose, docker swarm and finally using Kubernetes. In all cases, the same Docker images were used:

- [Postgres (postgres:latest)](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)
- ~~[Apache HTTPd + mod_cluster (rafabene/mod_cluster:latest)](https://hub.docker.com/r/rafabene/mod_cluster/)~~
- [Apache HTTPd + mod_cluster (karm/mod_cluster-master-dockerhub:latest)](https://hub.docker.com/r/karm/mod_cluster-master-dockerhub/)
- ~~[Wildfly + Ticket Monster (rafabene/wildfly-ticketmonster:latest)](https://hub.docker.com/r/rafabene/wildfly-ticketmonster/)~~
- [Wildfly + Ticket Monster HA (rafabene/wildfly-ticketmonster-ha:latest)](https://hub.docker.com/r/rafabene/wildfly-ticketmonster-ha/)

Note that no changes were required in the prepared image to run in all environments.

The required files and instructions are available in [github.com/rafabene/devops-demo](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo)

## Docker 

The first thing that we learn is how to execute docker containers using *docker* command. 

The instructions to run this environment using docker CLI only is available  [here](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo/blob/master/Dockerfiles/ticketmonster-ha/Readme.md). I suggest you to execute these instructions before moving on. Basically you will need to execute each one of these containers individually.

Note that the [postgres image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) uses [environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables) (POSTGRES_USER and POSTGRES_PASSWORD) to define the username and password of that container. 

All containers are execute in a single Docker host (where the *daemon* is running) but each container has his own internal IP address (which changes each container execution). To be able to make Wildfly image to talk with Postgres, ~~a ["container link"](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/#connect-with-the-linking-system) is created. When *--link* is specified, docker updates the */etc/hosts* file with the IP address with the linked container.~~ a ["docker  network"](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/) is created. When *--net* is specified, docker updates the */etc/hosts* file with the IP address with the linked container.

To execute more than one WildFly instance, you will have to execute multiple containers manually. Note that WildFly containers doesn't specify [port mappings](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#expose-incoming-ports) because we don't want/need to access WildFly directly.

The cons of this approach is that you need to execute all containers individually with the proper docker params to make the cluster work. 

## Docker Compose

The docker solution to simplify the execution of multiple containers with the proper params is to use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Docker Compose allows to specify an YAML file that contains the definitions for each container.

Here you can see the content of the YAML file for this environment:

{% highlight yaml linenos %}
db:
  container_name: "db"
  image: postgres
  net: mynet
  ports:
     - "5432:5432"
  environment:
    - POSTGRES_USER=ticketmonster
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ticketmonster-docker
modcluster:
  container_name: "modcluster"
  net: mynet
  image: karm/mod_cluster-master-dockerhub
  environment:
    - MODCLUSTER_NET=192. 172. 10. 179.
    - MODCLUSTER_PORT=80
  ports:
     - "80:80"
wildfly:
  image: rafabene/wildfly-ticketmonster-ha
  net: mynet
{% endhighlight %}

The instructions to run this environment using Docker compose is available [here](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo/blob/master/compose/Readme.md). I suggest you to execute these instructions before moving on.

Note that a single commmand ( *docker-compose up -d* ) can start the whole cluster with the proper params and links between the containers. It even build the image dynamically.

Scale WildFly is simple as *docker-compose scale wildfly=5*

The cons of this approach is that we have a physical limit on how many WildFly instances we can run simultaneously. Remeber that every container still being executed in a single Docker host (docker *daemon*).


## Docker Swarm

> "Docker Swarm is native clustering for Docker. It allows you create and access to a pool of Docker hosts using the full suite of Docker tools." (https://docs.docker.com/swarm/)

When you have a docker swarm cluster you will see all docker nodes as a single one. The only difference is that your container can be executed on any docker node in the cluster. 

![](/images/swarm_cluster.jpg)

Since Docker 1.9, a new container network model was introduced which allows containers in different hosts to be part of a [multi-host network.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/get-started-overlay/).

~~Docker compose can also be used with few modifications in the YAML file.~~

To execute this environment in Docker Swarm, follow the instructions available [here](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo/blob/master/swarm/Readme.md). Once more, I suggest you to execute these instructions before moving on.


## Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) have a lot of contributions from [big companies](http://kubernetes.io/community/) to have a solution *"for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of host"*.

I still need to prepare a blog post with more details about Kubernetes concepts (*nodes, replication controllers, services, labels, pods, etc*). Before Swarm and OpenShift v3, Kubernetes was a natural choice for people who are familiar with Docker containers and wanted to run it in a cluster.

The Kubernetes installation is a little bit more tricky with different approachs as you can see here: [http://kubernetes.io/gettingstarted/](http://kubernetes.io/gettingstarted/). The most easy way to have Kubernetes running is run:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=vagrant
curl -sS https://get.k8s.io | bash
{% endhighlight  %}

If you have a Kubernetes cluster running, you can try the Kubernetes instructions for the same docker environment [here](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo/blob/master/swarm/Readme.md).

You can see how powerful is Kubernetes in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAS5Mq9EktI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAS5Mq9EktI) - Ray Tsang (Google) and Arjen Wassink (Quintor) demonstrate at Devoxx Antwerp 2015 what happens when you pull the plug on a Docker cluster running on Raspberry Pi's.


## OpenShift v3

Finally we land in [OpenShift v3](https://www.openshift.org).

> "OpenShift 3 is built around a core of application containers powered by Docker, with orchestration and management provided by Kubernetes, on a foundation of Atomic and Enterprise Linux. OpenShift Origin is the upstream community project that brings it all together along with extensions, to accelerate application development and deployment." (http://www.openshift.org/)

In the next weeks I'll be updating the material available at [github.com/rafabene/devops-demo](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo) to include instructions to OpenShift

# Conclusion

This is a suggested learning path focused in a real use case using only containers for loadbalancer, application and database.

Of course some users may want to skip certain tools, but taking a ride to execute the same image in raw Docker CLI, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm + Compose, and Kubernetes will definetely give them the ability to understand the tools that you have available and choose the best for their needs.

Thanks for the reading!
