title: JBCAA for EAP6

Today I received my exam results for the JBCAA – *JBoss Certified Application Administrator* – for EAP6.

Most people asked me why take another certification since you’re already a JBCAA for EAP5. That’s easy to answer: EAP6 has fully changed. It’s basically a new product with new (and wonderful) features.

I didn’t take any training for this certification  (but that’s another long and sad history), but as a Red Hat employee I have used the JB248 course books and read it all. Then I read the [exam objectives](http://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex248-red-hat-certified-jboss-administration-rhcja-exam) and did one of each objective to practice. The most hard part is to setup a TCP based cluster.

For those who uses JBoss in their infrastructure: Don’t loose the chance to work with the new EAP in Domain mode. It’s simply awesome!
