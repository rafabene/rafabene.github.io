Yesterday I had the chance to take the exam **1Z0-1085-20 - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations 2020 Associate**.

This exam covers:

- General cloud concepts
- Architecture (regions, availability domains, fault domains, compartments)
- Core services (Networking, Compute, Storage, Database, Identity)
- Security
- Pricing and billing

Because it's a *foundation* exam, it is helpping me to give the base for other OCI certifications that I'm planning to take (Architect and Developer).

If you want to prepare yourself for this certification, look at the following [learning path](https://learn.oracle.com/ols/learning-path/understand-oci-foundations/35644/75258). 

Also, use the opportunity to take this (and other OCI certifications) [for FREE until May 15th 2020](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/blog/free-certifications-oracle-oci-autonomous-033020.html).

**My tips for this exam are**: Watch carefully (twice at least) the available training online, and take notes about each slide/topic. Understant the differences for each service offering (what is include and what is not included). Make sure to understand OCI architecture, and how it helps availability and reliability. 
SLA is not covered in the online training, so read it in the [documentation](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/iaas/sla.html).

See you!
