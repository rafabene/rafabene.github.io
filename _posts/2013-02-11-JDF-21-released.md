Last week during a team meeting, [JDF 2.1.Final](http://www.jboss.org/jdf/) was released.

In this release, users can now have a taste of [JDG – JBoss Data Grid](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/data-grid) through [6 new Quickstarts](http://www.jboss.org/developer-materials/#!sys_type=quickstart&query=jdg) that shows from a basic helloworld applicaton to more complex examples.

And what about [Deltaspike](http://deltaspike.apache.org/documentation/)? Do you want to give a try on some exiting features? [7 Quickstarts](http://www.jboss.org/developer-materials/#!sys_type=quickstart&query=deltaspike) shows each one of these features in a simple and comprensive way.

To help managing your projects, some BOMs were added to Stacks. Take a look on [JDF Stacks page](http://www.jboss.org/jdf/stack/stacks/).

Enjoyed ?

[Want to contribute](http://www.jboss.org/get-involved/)? JDF has now a Contributing guide for each of its subproject. Don’t be afraid. You can contribute with Quickstarts, BOMs, Archetypes, etc.

More news are coming. Stay tuned!
