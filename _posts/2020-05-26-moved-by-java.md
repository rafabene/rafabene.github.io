On May 23rd 2020, [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/) completed 25 years as one of the most popular and powerful platforms of all times.

A [serie of events](https://www.oracle.com/java/moved-by-java/) is happening throughout this year to celebrate this great milestone. By the way, don't miss [the event tomorrow](https://t.co/HtjyIEKrNh?amp=1) where I and my friends [Otávio Santana](https://twitter.com/otaviojava), [Karina Varela](https://twitter.com/kvarel4) and [Paulo Simões](https://twitter.com/pasimoes) will be discussing the next 25 years of Java.

Another great way to celebrate this aniversary is having Java developers worldwide sharing their memories using the hashtag [#MovedByJava](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MovedByJava?src=hashtag_click). I even [posted mine](https://twitter.com/rafabene/status/1263874302262345728), just to realise that Twitter's current limit of 280 characters is not enough for so many memories. Then I decided to write my memories of Java in this blog post. Here they are:
