Last week happened the [Devoxx Morocco 2015](http://devoxx.ma/en/). It was the fist Devoxx in Africa, being hosted in [Casablanca, Morocco](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Casablanca,+Morocco/).

That was my first Devoxx and I have to say that it was an honor be part of it as a [speaker](/talks/). My first "university" session was scheduled on Monday at 8:30 AM. It was a thankful surprise to see a lot of people interest to take a ride through the Docker universe using the ["Docker for Java Developers - Hands on Lab"](http://bit.ly/DockerKubernetes). Different versions of this lab have been presented to more than a thousand developers around the world by [Arun Gupta](http://blog.arungupta.me/javaee7-lab-wildfly-docker/), [Markus Eisele](http://blog.eisele.net/2015/10/docker-for-java-ee-developers-javvaone.html) and me. 

The "university" covered Docker basics, image creation, WildFly container deployment, composition and scale with Docker Compose and a brief introduction to Kubernetes concepts like Pods, Replication Controller, Services and Labels. The presented material is available at [http://bit.ly/DockerKubernetes](http://bit.ly/DockerKubernetes).

Next day I talked about [DeltaSpike - the CDI toolbox](http://rafabene.com/deltaspike-cdi-toolbox/) and it was very satisfying to see a lot of questions and people interested on it. 

One of the best things about these events is to meet people. It was a great opportunity to see again old colleagues ([Markus Eisele](https://twitter.com/myfear), [Aslak Knutsen](https://twitter.com/aslakknutsen), [Yara Senger](Yara M H Senger) and [Vinicius Senger](https://twitter.com/vsenger)); and make new ones ([Thomas Modeneis](https://twitter.com/THOMASMODENEIS), [Katarina Dabo](https://twitter.com/cafecortadonet), [Ray Tsang (The Kubernetes guy)](https://twitter.com/saturnism), [Dan Allen (The Asciidoctor guy)](https://twitter.com/mojavelinux), [Schalk Cronjé](https://twitter.com/ysb33r), [Stephan Janssen](https://twitter.com/stephan007), [Chiara Chiappini](https://twitter.com/chiarachiappini), [Maxime David](https://twitter.com/Xouuox), [Louis Jacomet](https://twitter.com/ljacomet), [John T Davies](https://twitter.com/jtdavies), [Pierre-A Grégoire](https://twitter.com/zepag), [Arnaud Héritier](https://twitter.com/aheritier), [Abdellatif BOUCHAMA](https://twitter.com/a_bouchama), [Amira LAKHAL](https://twitter.com/MiraLak), and many others). 

The organization by [Morocco JUG](https://twitter.com/MoroccoJUG) and its folks ([Badr Elhouari ](https://twitter.com/badrelhouari) - a great host - and his wife [Hanae EL BOUYOUSFI](https://twitter.com/delight1987); [Faissal Boutaounte](https://twitter.com/bfaissal), [Aboullaite Mohammed](https://twitter.com/laytoun), etc) made the DevoxxMA even more friendly. The event had a partnership with [AIESEC](http://www.aiesec.ma/) - An organization that develops youths ([Wilfred Omondi](https://twitter.com/wilfomcoluoch), [Hind Kossara](https://twitter.com/HindKossara) and many others students who worked at DevoxxMA as a voluteer) to improve their leadership skills. 

I did exactly how it was well said at the Devoxx banner (as you can see at the above picture): 

> "#DevoxxMA is a unique opportunity to rub shoulders with best quality people from around the world! Share, learn, hack, network, get inspired & *don't miss to have a lot of fun :)*"
