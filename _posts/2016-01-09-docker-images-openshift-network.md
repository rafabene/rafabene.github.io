title: From Docker images to OpenShift + Docker Networks
---

On my [last post](/2015/12/15/docker-learning-path-wildfly/), I talked about how to run the same set of Docker images using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/) and [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/).

The purpose was to show a suggested learning path from raw Docker CLI to a distrubute Docker cluster (using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes).

As I promissed, I've updated this lab to include two new features that I want to show:

- Docker Networks

- OpenShift v3

## Docker Networks

Since [Docker 1.9](https://blog.docker.com/2015/11/docker-1-9-production-ready-swarm-multi-host-networking/), networking is now a first class citizen and ready to use with Docker Swarm and Compose.

With the introduction of [Docker Networks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/dockernetworks/), [Docker Linking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/) is expected to be deprecated and removed in a future release.   

The environment consists in a [WildFly](http://www.wildfly.org/) container with [Ticket Monster application](http://www.jboss.org/ticket-monster/) connected to a [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) container. To load balance the application, I use [Apache httpd](https://httpd.apache.org/) with [mod_cluster](http://mod-cluster.jboss.org/). The overview diagram of this environment can be seen in the following picture:

Now, the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo/blob/master/compose/docker-compose.yml) file contains reference to a docker network called *"mynet"*. This network should be available before the execution of the container through the command  *docker network create mynet*. 

With [multi-host networks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/get-started-overlay/) available, the same [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo/blob/master/compose/docker-compose.yml) file is now being used also on the [Docker Swarm cluster instructions](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo/blob/master/swarm/Readme.md).

When a network is specified in Docker container, the `/etc/hosts` file of all other containers in the network is updated to include the name of the container. You can see this behaviour running the following commands:

{% highlight bash %}
$ docker network create mynet
$ docker run -d --name container1 --net mynet jboss/wildfly
$ docker run -d --name container2 --net mynet jboss/wildfly
$ docker run -d --name container3 --net mynet jboss/wildfly

$ docker exec container1 cat /etc/hosts
....
172.18.0.3	container2
172.18.0.3	container2.mynet
172.18.0.4	container3
172.18.0.4	container3.mynet
{% endhighlight %}

## OpenShift v3

Another great addition was the inclusal of [*OpenShift instructions*](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo/blob/master/openshift/Readme.md) for the same lab. 

One of the biggest differences is that OpenShift provides [*Routes feature*](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html) that allows external host name mapping and load balancing. Due to this "native" feature, we don't need to deploy [mod_cluster](http://mod-cluster.jboss.org/) as part of the lab environment. 

Instead of using the [default PostgreSQL image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/), OpenShift provides a [Docker image for running PostgreSQL](https://hub.docker.com/r/openshift/postgresql-92-centos7/). This image can provide database services based on username, password, and database name settings provided via configuration.

After deploying the Database, the [*OpenShift README*](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo/blob/master/openshift/Readme.md) contains instructions to deploy the WildFly using two methods. Choose one:

- Using 3 CLI commands to deploy a POD, a Service and a Router, each one.
- Use a single command to deploy the POD, Service and Router defined in a [YAML file](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo/blob/master/openshift/wildfly-rc-service-route.yaml).

One of the greatest contributions of this lab adition, is that it can also be used as an overview guide to run `Docker images inside OpenShift`.

Don't forget to check the recently added [*OpenShift instructions*](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo/blob/master/openshift/Readme.md) 

## Conclusion

While following the instructions of [github.com/rafabene/devops-demo](https://github.com/rafabene/devops-demo), you will face 5 different ways to have the same environment being executed with only [Docker tools](http://www.docker.com/products/overview#/docker_toolbox) (Compose, Machine, Swarm) and also with [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) and [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.org/).

Executing it in the proposed order can provide you a didatic guide on how they are related to each other. This lab can also be used as a template for your most of middleware containers and applications, and at the same time, You will be in touch with the latest version and features of the Docker universe since I plan to continue updating this test environment frequently.
