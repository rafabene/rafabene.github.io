Finally this weekend I concluded the migration of my blog to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and publish it under [rafabene.com](http://rafabene.com) domain. I will talk about this process in another blog post since I have a lot of to write.

I love express ideas but to be honest, since 2010 a stopped writting blog posts and start using [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/rafabene/) to express them. But it has been several years that I miss to have more than a short 140-character message. The easy of twitter has made me lazy about writting.

My lazyness to write blog posts had an excuse: I had recently joined [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com) in 2009 as a *"JBoss Consultant"* and my weekly rountine consisted in travelling the whole Brazil to support and assist costumers using [JBoss products](http://www.jboss.org/products/). From Monday to Friday I was out of my home and deeply involved in the costumer project; thinking and making [PoCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) at nights to propose them a solution on the next day and implement it. As a Consultant I had a chance to meet gorgeous projects and amazing people in several cities like: [São Paulo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/São+Paulo+-+State+of+São+Paulo,+Brazil), [Rio de Janeiro](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rio+de+Janeiro,+RJ,+Brazil/), [São José dos Campos](https://www.google.com/maps/place/São+José+dos+Campos+-+SP,+Brazil), [Campinas](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Campinas+-+State+of+São+Paulo,+Brazil), [Belém](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Belém+-+PA,+Brazil/), [Belo-Horizonte](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Belo+Horizonte+-+State+of+Minas+Gerais,+Brazil), [Vitória](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vitoria,+Belo+Horizonte+-+MG,+Brazil), [João Pessoa](https://www.google.com/maps/place/João+Pessoa,+State+of+Paraíba,+Brazil), [Aracajú](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aracaju+-+SE,+Brazil), and my beloved [Goiânia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Goiânia+-+State+of+Goiás,+Brazil).

After 3 years as a JBoss Consultant, in 2012 I was transfered to the *"Sofware Engineer"* role on the former project [JDF - JBoss Developer Framework](/2013/03/13/what-is-JDF/). This project today is now known as [JBoss Developer Materials](http://www.jboss.org/developer-materials/#!) which I'm currently leading it. 

In 2014 I joined the [Apache DeltaSpike](http://deltaspike.apache.org/) team to [contribute with it](https://github.com/apache/deltaspike/graphs/contributors) and in 2015 I become part of DeltaSpike P.M.C (Project Management Committee)

Finally, in the beginning of 2015 I made one of the biggest change of my life: I moved to [Raleigh, NC](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Raleigh,+NC). Is it definitive or how long will I stay here? I don't know! But I'm using this opportunity to improve my English and keep learning. This 2015 I was much more focused in tools like [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/), [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/index.html), [Vagrant](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/) and [Fabric8](http://fabric8.io/).

Yes! I still miss to do *"Software Development"* and because of that I'm using my free time to learn "Javascript" frameworks like [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) and tools like [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)/[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), etc. To get more practice with Angular, I rencetly started to contribute with [Openshift Origin](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/4704/). But all of these "Javascript" histories are subjects for a next post.

Cya!
