At this moment I'm inside the airplane heading from Orlando MCO airport to San Francisco (SFO). Since the last couple days have been crazy, I needed to use the airplane's Wi-fi to setup the environment for my two sessions at Red Hat Summit.

## A Java developer's journey to Kubernetes and OpenShift

Tomorrow, Tuesday afternoon (3:30 PM - 5:30 PM) there will be a talk that I'm really looking forward.

In this two-hour session with [Burr Sutter](https://twitter.com/burrsutter) we have prepared a true journey that will guide people from the principles af MSA (Microservices Architectures) to Servicemesh with Istio. This talk will give the attendees the chance to understand what microservices are, why the IT industry is so interested in such architecture, what are the invokation and deployment patterns, and some practices like circuit breaks, authentication and authorization, scaling, logging, monitoring, tracing; and also some DevOps pratices like CI/CD Pipelines, Blue/Green and Canary deployments.

After this introduction, the attendees will understand how Kubernetes works and they will learn how too deploy cloud-native applications in a container orchestration environment like Kubernetes and OpenShift.

To boost their start-up time of producing cloud-native applications, we will cover [RHOAR](https://launch.openshift.io/) (Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes), which supports [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), [WildFly Swarm](http://wildfly-swarm.io/), [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).

Finally they will learn about service mesh using [Istio](https://istio.io/) and understand how side-car containers can bring the following features for free:

- Intelligent Routing and Load-Balancing
  - A/B Tests
  - Smarter Canary Releases 
- Chaos: Fault Injection
- Resilience: Circuit Breakers
- Observability: Metrics and Tracing
- Fleet wide policy enforcement

If you are curious about Istio, you can try our workshop that have been published last month at <https://learn.openshift.com/servicemesh>

## Why you’re going to FAIL running Java on docker

In this section I'll explore an subject that became very hot since last year.

Since everyone is deploying their application in a container, not every developer or sysadmin was aware of possible issues that could happen when the JVM is running inside a container.

I've blog about it at <https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/03/14/java-inside-docker/> and since then, I've update it twice to cover JDK9 and JDK10 behaviours.

Today I even released a translation of the blog post "Why you’re going to FAIL running Java on docker" to [Portuguese](/2018/05/07/java-no-docker) to help Java portuguese language communities to understand what they should know to avoid a complete FAILURE when running Java inside docker.

- **Date:** Wednesday, May 9 
- **Time:** 11:45 AM - 12:30 PM

I hope to see you all there! Cya!
