title: JavaOne 2015 - Day 1 and 2
---

This is a small review on what happened on Sunday and Monday on JavaOne 2015.

Sunday when I arrived at [Moscone Center](http://www.moscone.com/site/do/index) in San Francisco I could realise how immense is the event. I always heard about that when I read about it in the [Brazilian Java Magazine](http://www.devmedia.com.br/revista-java-magazine) but nothing compares to see it in person. On that day, I joined the Java Keynote with some [Brazilians colleagues](https://twitter.com/yanaga/status/658392253920993281/photo/1) ([Edson Yanaga](https://twitter.com/yanaga), [Otávio Santana](https://twitter.com/otaviojava), [Michael "Mr M." Nascimento](https://twitter.com/mr__m), [Bruno "JavaMan" Souza](https://twitter.com/brjavaman)) and also with [Burr Sutter](https://twitter.com/burrsutter)

One of the greatest surprises was to see [Scott McNealy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McNealy) presenting the "Java Developer Nightmares of 2015". I [ROFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOL) when he mentioned 

>"You love open source software and sharing but work at Oracle" 

because I have quite a few friends working there :p - You can see this moment here recorded [on video](https://youtu.be/9jvRfJqBMOM?t=1m35s). 

After the Java Keynote, I joined the [Red Hat Kickoff drink-up](http://developers.redhat.com/events/javaone/2015/) where I found [Alexandre Porcelli](https://twitter.com/porcelli), [Jason Porter](https://twitter.com/lightguardjp), [Markus Eisele](https://twitter.com/myfear), [Sébastien Blanc](https://twitter.com/sebi2706), [Ken Finnigan](https://twitter.com/kenfinnigan), [Sanne Grinovero](https://twitter.com/SanneGrinovero), [Aslak Knutsen](https://twitter.com/aslakknutsen), [Max Andersen](https://twitter.com/maxandersen) [Ray Plosky](https://twitter.com/rayploski) and [José Paumard](https://twitter.com/JosePaumard). To conclude my Sunday, I joined the Welcome Reception in front of Moscone Center where I made a [video shot about a DJI Inspire One flying there](https://youtu.be/kpMiQjXa1ds).

Monday I went to Red Hat booth where I saw and talked with [Andrew Lee Rubinger](https://twitter.com/ALRubinger), [Ray Plosky](https://twitter.com/rayploski), [James Cobb](https://twitter.com/insectengine) and [Steve Speicher](https://twitter.com/sspeiche). There I got my new book "Modern Java EE Design Patterns" written by the Java Champion [Markus Eisele](https://twitter.com/myfear). You can get the FREE book on his Blog:

Afternoon I got a big achievement in my career: I spoke at JavaOne ✓. I presented "DeltaSpike - the CDI Toolbox" with [Antoine Sabot-Durand](https://twitter.com/antoine_sd), the CDI 2.0 spec leader. The slides of our talk are available at [http://rafabene.com/deltaspike-cdi-toolbox/](http://rafabene.com/deltaspike-cdi-toolbox/). Many thanks to everyone that was there! We had people from United States, Turkey, Tunisia, Bulgaria, Finland, Guatemala, Germany, Denmark, Canada, Switzerland, United Kingdon, South Africa, Chile and Brazil :)
