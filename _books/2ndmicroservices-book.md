The microservice architectural approach reaches into the foundation of your organization, letting you build complex systems to adapt to rapidly changing competitive markets. Now in its second edition, this step-by-step guide introduces concepts like immutable delivery, and gets you started building distributed systems for managing microservices using Linux containers, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), and three different [Java](https://www.java.com/) frameworks: [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot),[Microprofile](http://microprofile.io/) and [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/).

This book explains how to:
- Expose a service.
- Configure at runtime.
- Expose metrics and insight.
- Call downstream services in a safe manner
