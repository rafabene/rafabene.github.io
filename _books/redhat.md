For a [decade](../../2019/07/12/I-joined-oracle/), from 2009 to 2019 I worked at Red Hat Inc. 

My last position there was as a Director of Developer Experience, position which allowed me to have more time to help Developers worldwide.

During that time, some great blog posts were produced.

This page contains a link to all blog posts published at <http://developers.redhat.com>
