In 2014, [Apache DeltaSpike](http://deltaspike.apache.org/) won the Duke's Choice Award, and in 2015 I became part of PMC. Even 5 year later, I'm still among [the top 5 contributor](https://github.com/apache/deltaspike/graphs/contributors) of this project.

My contributions are not only related to source code, but I also spread the project to other developers by writing this article in the Brazilian Java Magazine.

A sample of this article is available [here](https://www.devmedia.com.br/apache-deltaspike-cdi-programavel/31982)
