No. I didn't write this amazing book from [Henrik Kniberg](https://www.crisp.se/konsulter/henrik-kniberg).

But as a big fan of this book, I joined the effort with other people to bring this incredible content to Portuguese. 

You can get the translated Portuguese version for free [here](https://www.infoq.com/br/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches/#minibookDownload/)
