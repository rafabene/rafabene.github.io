On May 2020, to celebrate the 25 years of Java, O'Reilly brings a commemorative book with 97 tips from the passionated Java professionals around the globe.

I became very honored when I received the invitation to write some words in this book. As an advice, I suggest developers to ["Really undestand what's happening under the hood"](https://medium.com/97-things/go-beyond-the-java-apis-go-deeper-c9fb34198fb7) from HTTP connections to SQL queries.

For other amazing tips, you can buy the book [here](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920048824.do).
